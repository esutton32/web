      <p>Hi there, I'm Ella, and this is my page for Composing Digital Media! I am currently a
        junior Museum Studies and History student at the University of Pittsburgh. I minor in French
        and am getting a certificate in Russian and Eastern European Studies. I consider myself as
        being from Northern Virginia, but I've lived all over the U.S. I'm hoping that this class
        will give me the opportunity to strengthen media skills I already have and broaden my
        horizons with new ones. I hope you enjoy checking out my projects!</p>

      <p>Here are some fun pictures! I'm doing an internship at the Hillman Archives and Special
        Collections where I look at old photos all day. I have to wear gloves, it's pretty exciting.
        I love musical theatre, and I recently got to see my favorite musical ever in person
        (Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812). I'm in a dance group at Pitt (@fresaatpitt)
        where we do dance covers of songs! The image on the top right is the thumbnail for my
        favorite cover, soon to be published on Youtube. The rest are silly images of me and my
        friends, some I made myself (see the Weezer pic). The one all the way to the right bottom is
        my puppy Callie who I love very much! As you can see from some of the pictures I have
        chosen, the way I interact with media, especially digital, influences the way I live my life
        on a daily basis. I hope that I will be able to better understand its formation through this
        class!</p>
